      <h3>Dog Theraphy Program</h3>
      <p>The moment a volunteer with a therapy dog walks into a room, you can instantly feel a change in mood.
       All eyes focus on them, as smiles spread across everyone’s faces.
       Therapy dogs are NOT service dogs.
        Service dogs are dogs who are specifically trained to perform a task or tasks to assist a person with a disability or impairment. 
        A service dog must be with their person at all times and has special access privileges in public places.</p>
     <p>Therapy Dog is an Pet Therapy program which recognizes the necessary therapy work performed by dogs through accepted organizations based on the number of visits. 
          Therapy work involves volunteers who schedule visits to various facilities and locations such a nursing homes, classrooms, libraries, assisted living centers, hospices, funeral homes, schools, shelters even courtrooms.</p>
     <p>Whether they’re working with a child who is learning to read, visiting a patient in a hospital or a senior in assisted living, therapy dogs and their owners work together as a team to improve the lives of other people. 
         A dog can provide a valuable sense of reassurance, joy, or calmness to people experiencing stressful, lonely or depressing situations or general times in their life.</p>
